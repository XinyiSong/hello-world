#Quality of Experience Hourglass Model
This paper proposes a conceptual model of QoE in parallel with the classical internet architecture hourglass model. Moreover conditions are highlighted under which QoE can be evaluated objectively from QoS without entailing other factors. The layers of QoE hourglass model are:  

1. Quality of Experience(QoE)  
QoE depends on QoP.
2. Quality of Presentation(QoP)  
QoP, where the end-user has a direct interaction and experience with the displaying devices and interface of applications. It depends on QoD, as well as hardware and software interface and usability.
3. Quality of Delivery(QoD)  
QoD concerns with the quality of data delivered. The quality of data delivery is two fold:  
(1)Quality of data delivered by the application. It is a result of the treatment of data by the application to enhance the end-to-end performance.  
(2)Quality of data delivered by the network. It is the cumulative effect of network performance parameters and data handling by transport layer protocols. It depends on QoS.
4. Quality of Service(QoS)  
QoS is a foundation layer of the model, which is measurable. The fundamental parameters of QoS are throughput, packet delay, packet delay variation and packet loss.
